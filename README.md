## Integrations

Databox users have often requested that we integrate with their favorite analytics or accounting service. Given the sheer volume of awesome services out there, it was a daunting goal to try to satisfy everyone. Instead, we sought a more scalable approach: open-sourced examples of integrations that anyone can use as a starting point.

Integrations are build using **Databox SDK** which allows you to integrate complex services with Databox and go beyond the integrations we provide out of the box.

You can read more about Databox SDK and PushAPI on [Databox developers portal](https://developers.databox.com/libraries).

## Examples
